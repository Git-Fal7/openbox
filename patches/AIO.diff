-3.6:
-  * Added various new abilities to If action, including the <query> tag,
-    matching class, name, role and window type.
-  * Added ForEach action.
-  * Restore the <center> option for window placement.
-  * New GrowToFill action.
-  * Updated Portuguese and Polish translations.
-  * New Galician translation.
-  * Added strict option to ToggleShowDesktop action.
-  * Speed optimization in rendering code.
-  * New <position> tag for ShowMenu action allows placing menus other
-    than at the mouse cursor.
-  * Fix some corner cases of relative position to work correctly.
-  * Allow specifying multiple mousebinds in one tag as we already do
-    for keybinds (separated by spaces, as "W-Return M-S-F3" for example).
-  * Added option rebindOnMappingNotify option, on by default, which
-    controls if we update binds when the keyboard layout changes at runtime.
-  * The resize action now only considers the part of the client that is onscreen
-    for purposes of picking an action to perform.
-  * Make desktop actions non-interactive (means you can have more actions bound
-    to a key after them, and the dialog disappears on a timer instead of when
-    releasing the modifier keys).
-  * obxprop is now not pathologically slow when printing very long arrays.
-  * Fix menu accelerator underlines sometimes not showing up.
-  * Fix so you can click menu entries before the menuHideDelay expires if it's
-    a new click.
-  * Don't readd the X event fd to the poll set every time we reconfigure.
-  * Fix some specialized button bitmaps not loading from the correct files.
-    (toggled + pressed or hover would just be the base toggled image).
-  * Various small bugfixes.
-
-3.5.2:

-  * Allow application rules to pick a monitor for new windows without forcing
-    a position.
-  * Allow non-interactive focus cycling with a new <interactive> tag.
-  * New LeastOverlap window placement policy replaces the old default
-    behaviour. It finds a place on a given monitor that overlaps as few
-    windows as possible. Contributed by Ian Zimmerman.
-  * Improved Xinerama behaviour.
-  * Correctly interface with latest gnome-session for Gnome/Openbox X sessions.
-  * Allow third-party control of window opacity in compositing managers.

-  * Further tweaks to the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message handling.  Use the same
-    logic for focus-stealing as is used when mapping a new window.
-  * Don't go out of our way any more to prevent focus from moving while the
-    keyboard is grabbed.
-  * Fix openbox-gnome-session when using gnome-session > 2.22.
-
-3.4.8-rc2:
-  * Updated translations: Italian, Croatian, Ukrainian.
-  * When resizing a window while focus cycling with bar=no, the bar no longer
-    reappears.
-  * Correctly handle shaped windows using the ShapeInput kind, this is used
-    by many composited apps to pass through clicks in their transparent areas.
-  * Fix the <monitor> per-app setting.
-  * Avoid using anonymous unions.
-  * Windows that had their decorations removed by per-app settings were still
-    placed as if they still had their decorations.
-  * Fix event handling not to ignore events on a window when they have an unmap
-    event in the queue, if that unmap event doesn't cause the window to be
-    unmanaged.
-  * Show the desktop switch on every monitor in xinerama.
-  * Fix interpretation of struts in xinerama where the screens have different
-    sizes.
-  * Add "next" and "prev" as possible <monitor> targets in the moveto and
-    resizeto actions.
-  * Allow escaping the _ used to mark the shortcut character in menu labels.
-    You can now change the (first) _ in a label to __, this will be displayed
-    as a single underscore. The rest of the _ in the string will be unaffected,
-    so only double the first one.
-  * Only replace ~ with the home directory when it is preceded by whitespace or
-    is at the start of the string, and when it is followed by a space, slash, or
-    the end of the string. This is implemented with GRegex, and so the required
-    glib version has been bumped to 2.14.
-  * Some other small fixes.
-
-3.4.8-rc1:
-  * Updated translations: Basque, Catalan, Turkish, Italian, Spanish, Russian.
-  * New translations: Danish, Turkish, Lithuanian.
-  * Set the _MOTIF_WM_INFO atom so urxvt uses motif hints for borderless mode.
-  * Properly escape the xml used in session files.
-  * Correct a 64-bit issue related to comparing timestamps.
-  * There is a sneaky sentence right at the end of a big paragraph in the
-    wm-spec document that says windows mapping with _NET_WM_USER_TIME=0 should
-    not be focused initially, honor this request.
-  * When moving a window to another desktop with following on, bring the
-    window's helper windows (for example gimp image windows with the toolbox
-    set to utility window).
-  * Change the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages again, if they originate from the
-    app and the window is on another desktop, just set the demands_attention
-    flag. If the event came from the user (ie pager/panel), then the window
-    is still moved to the current desktop.
-
-3.4.7.2:
-  * The system I used to generate the dist tarball didn't have the
-    docbook-to-man command so the manpages were empty.
-
-3.4.7.1:
-  * Not to be outdone by the cairo team, I introduced a bug in the last release
-    which made resizing not give any feedback. This is now fixed.
-
-3.4.7:
-  * Fully updated Czech, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, German,
-    French, Hungarian, Norwegian, Vietnamese, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish,
-    Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese and Portuguese translations
-  * Partially updated Spanish translation
-  * Add an example of the "force" option for the per-app placement options to
-    the default rc.xml file
-  * Add a new xdg-autostart script.  This will eventually end up in the PyXDG
-    distribution hopefully, but it is included in Openbox for now.  This script
-    runs things based on the freedesktop.org autostart specification.  You can
-    have it run GNOME, KDE, ROX, or XFCE specific things if you want.  The
-    new default system-wide autostart.sh script runs it automatically
-  * Update the default menu.xml to include a lot of common apps
-  * Fix white font shadows (negative shadowtint)
-  * Update the autostart.sh to find gnome-settings-daemon correctly, as the
-    GNOME people have moved it to libexec
-  * Fix focus possibly getting stolen when using the Focus action
-  * Drastically speed up rendering of Vertical and SplitVertical gradients
-  * Speed improvements also for Horizonal and Pyramid gradients
-  * Add new theme options, menu.overlap.x and menu.overlap.y options, that let
-    you independently control the horizontal and vertical position of submenus
-  * Change _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages to not change the current desktop, but
-    to bring the window to the current desktop instead.  This is the industry
-    standard policy
-  * Use the pretty new openbox.png icon as the default window icon
-  * Allow matching per-application rules to windows by their window type
-    (normal, dialog, splash, etc).  The default rc.xml has more details
-  * Add new Openbox-themed prompt windows.  Use these prompt windows to ask
-    before killing off windows that aren't responding.  This also means we
-    don't need to ping every window constantly forever
-  * Add a new <prompt> option to the Execute action.  If this is set to a
-    string, a dialog will be shown with that string in it and "yes"/"no"
-    buttons.  The command to be executed will only be run if the user selects
-    "yes" in the dialog
-  * Add a new <prompt> option to the Exit action, which is a boolean (not a
-    string).  When true, Openbox will show a dialog confirming if you want to
-    exit.  The default is to show the prompt
-  * Reduce Openbox's memory footprint and speed up rendering through the use
-    of a new icon cache, so that Openbox only needs to keep 1 copy of an icon
-    when 100 different windows share it
-  * Make Openbox menus have the "menu type" hint for compositors to see and use
-  * Fix the MoveResizeTo action for negative coords (opposite edges)
-  * Fix key bindings getting lost if multiple bindings at the same level could
-    not be translated (Fixes VMWare causing Openbox keybindings to stop
-    working)
-  * Fix the resize popup box for terminal windows with a base size of 0 (show
-    the right size values for urxvt terminals)
-  * Fix some off-by-one bugs with the edge growing/shrinking code
-  * Add new theme options for menu line separators: menu.separator.color,
-    menu.separator.width, menu.separator.padding.width,
-    menu.separator.padding.height
-  * Add xfce-mcs-manager to the default autostart.sh, and run it automatically
-    when gnome-settings-daemon is not present to have GTK apps inherit settings
-    from the XFCE configuration tools
-  * Make the send-to-desktop menu in the client-menu indicate which is the current
-    desktop for omnipresent windows, and don't close it if just toggling
-    omni-presence when ctrl-clicking
-  * Add a new SessionLogout action that logs out through the session manager,
-    when running Openbox within a session manager such as within an
-    GNOME/Openbox or KDE/Openbox session.  The action includes a <prompt>
-    option which is similar to the Exit action's
-  * Add a new gdm-control command that lets you control gdm from within an X
-    session.  The gdm-control lets you change GDM's behaviour for when you end
-    the current session.  For instance, you can tell GDM to reboot, and
-    then immediately log out of the current session, and the computer will be
-    rebooted
-  * Show an information dialog when an error occurs for Openbox, such as when
-    the Execute action fails or when XML syntax errors are present in the
-    configuration files
-  * When making a window very narrow, don't draw buttons to the right of the title
-    on top of the ones on its left.
-
-3.4.6.1:
-  * Updated Clearlooks theme
-  * Add the force="yes/no" option for the per-app settings' <position> tag
-  * Raise and focus modal children and their direct parents together, improved
-    usability with direct modal transient windows
-  * Fix crash when using <raise> for NextWindow and there are no windows
-    to move focus to
-  * Add the <manageDesktops> option in the rc.xml <menu> section, which toggles
-    the "Manage Desktops" section appearing in the combined-client-list-menu
-  * Fix for menu headers showing the wrong text
-  * Fix for the <focusLast> behavior
-  * Treat modal direct children as one window with their parent consistently
-
-3.4.6:
-  * Added Basque translation
-  * Updated French, Vietnamese German, Simplified Chinese, Russian, Portuguese,
-    Brasilian Portuguese, Norwegian, and Finnish translations
-  * New Clearlooks theme, updated by David Barr

-    bindings on the fly
-  * Fix focus moving incorrectly sometimes with focus under mouse enabled
-  * Make default configuration focus the desktop when you right click

-    you to have your target window temporarily raised above all others, and to
-    turn the focus target indicator bar off
-  * Improve the LastDesktop action to not remember desktops you skipped across
-  * Ignore mouse clicks that are made on override-redirect (unmanaged) windows
-  * When opening a menu with a key binding, don't use the key binding to run
-    something in the menu
-  * Add a <monitor> option for window placement, which gives you the option
-    to place new windows on the active monitor, or the monitor where the mouse
-    is, instead of on any monitor (for xinerama multihead setups)
-  * Add options for placing the window move/resize coordinate popup window in
-    a fixed position on screen, rather than relative to the window being
-    moved or resized
-  * Prevent the dock from auto-hiding completely offscreen if the theme has
-    no borders for it
-  * New icon
-  * Fix race condition when running things that want to grab the keyboard
-    (e.g. gnome-panel-control --main-menu)
-  * When dialog windows ask to not appear in the taskbar, still give them focus
-    in normal ways (fixes new GNOME session logout dialogs)
-  * Fix bug with resizing corners on certain parts of the window frame
-  * Ping applications to tell when they are running or have become frozen.
-    Show a [Not Responding] message in the title bar of windows which are
-    frozen.
-  * When closing a window which is [Not Responding], kill the window's process
-    if it is running on the same machine as Openbox.  Otherwise, just
-    disconnect
-    the window from the X display.  A second attempt to close a [Not
-    Responding]
-    window will kill it forcefully (kill -9).
-  * Fixes for internal timers
-  * Add a <wmclass> option for the execute action's startup-notification.  This
-    lets you tell Openbox that the application will map a window with the
-    specified class - for applications that do not support startup-notification
-    natively.
-  * Fix for empty dock taking up space onscreen after a reconfigure
-  * Reduce Openbox's additional memory footprint per-window and per-menu
-  * Faster horizontal gradient rendering
-  * Don't deiconify windows that aren't allowed to be directly iconified on
-    restart (eg toolbars), as they can be iconified by other means
-  * Improve support for fullscreen windows in xinerama (TwinView) and
-    multiple-screen setups
-  * Add a --config-file command line option, to specify an alternate
-    configuration file path
-

-  * Added Hungarian translation
-  * Updated Finnish, Russian, German and French translations
-  * Fixed some very minor memory leaks
-  * Hide the desktop popup when showing the focus popup
-  * Fix a crash when trying to access the More... menu of
-    client-list-combined-menu
-  * Fix the coordinate popup only showing up on the first monitor in xinerama
-  * Add --exit to exit the currently running openbox instance
-
-3.4.4:
-  * Updated Traditional Chinese translation
-  * Updated Norwegian translation
-  * Fix for MoveToEdge skipping edges sometimes
-  * Let you specify the vertical and horizontal padding independently in themes
-  * Fix so that if you select an omnipresent window on another desktop in the
-    client list menus, it will go to that desktop
-  * Make the GrowToEdge action shrink once there is no more room to grow,
-    similar to in 3.4.2, but shrinking to edges as well
-  * Move the Send To and Layers submenus to the top of the client menu

-    very quickly

-    resized inside of the struts (Fixes Acroread)
-  * Accept the <command> option for the Restart command, similar to the Execute
-    action
-  * Don't make clicking on dock apps sometimes act like clicking on the root
-    window (Don't propogate button events up)
-  * Fix a bug introduced in 3.4.3 which caused the Windows key as a modifier
-    for bindings to not work properly
-  * Let windows skip across monitors in a Xinerama setup when using MoveToEdge
-    or Shift-arrow in an interactive move
-  * Make move and resize take the dock into account for resistance
-  * Raise new windows when it makes sense, when they aren't being focused
-  * Change default config to use click events for mouse wheel bindings instead
-    of presses
-
-3.4.3:
-  * Add Ukrainian translation
-  * Updated translations:
-    - Japanese, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Estonian, German, Portuguese,
-      Vietnamese, Finnish, Czech, Arabic, Spanish, Swedish, French
-  * Improve focus fallback - don't fallback to windows you can't focus cycle
-    (Alt-Tab) to
-  * Don't show the client border for undecorated windows when keepBorder is on,
-    just the outer border
-  * Some improvements in the smart placement to help it find a place more
-    often.  This needs more work still.
-  * Don't focus windows that appear under the mouse in mouse-focus mode unless
-    underMouse is enabled
-  * Don't move focus when the window under the pointer iconifies unless

-    xinerama functionality.
-  * Fixes for how the dock is placed in certain positions on screen (off by 1
-    errors)
-  * New default bindings:

-    incarnation may return in the future.
-  * Add optional <finalactions> option for NextWindow, PreviousWindow,
-    DirectionalFocus*, and DirectionalTarget* actions
-  * Don't focus new helper windows unless they are alone in their group.  This

-    - Arrow will move the window by a larger number of pixels
-  * Fancy keyboard window resizing:
-    - The first arrow will choose an edge to resize (then you can grow or

-      is user-specified)
-  * Add user-specified margins to the configuration file
-  * Fix for transient windows in groups with transient windows of the group
-    transients.  That wasn't supposed to be legible.  i.e. 2 group transients
-    and 1 direct transient for one of the group transients.
-  * Don't include child/parent windows in tests for being occluded or occluding
-    other windows, since you can't raise/lower above/below them.  This fixes

-  * Reduce the size of the middle gradient in splitvertical gradients.  This
-    makes the split harder than it was in 3.4.2
-  * Don't include debian/ dir in releases
-  * Add resize bindings for the edges to the default hardcoded bindings
-  * Fix focus cycle indicator positioning for some windows (i.e. OpenOffice)

-    you move a window to any edge of any screen.
-  * Make actions that look for edges include the dock's edges (e.g. MoveToEdge)
-  * New preferred option for the Execute action is <command> instead of

-    partically too
-  * Require libstartupnotification 0.8 in configure (we use stuff that was not
-    around in some earlier versions)
-  * Grab the server when mapping windows to avoid race conditions in other
-    programs (getting MapNotify before you are visible)
-  * Handle case gracefully when ConfigureRequent for restacking specifies
-    a siblig which we aren't managing
-  * Use KeyRelease to run things from Openbox menus, so that the release
-    does not go to the focused window (causing the new window to not get

-    prevention (Fixes Tilda)
-  * Send ConfigureNotify always on ConfigureRequest (Previous emacs fix
-    makes this possible now)
-  * Fix RelativeResize action for right/bottom edges
-  * Remove SCIM from the default autostart.sh - it has caused problems with
-    some (buggy) panels, such as pypanel
-  * Fix the titlebar changing to non-focused when iconifying a window with
-    animation
-  * Use the new osd theme hints for the dock, rather than the titlebar hints
-  * Fix rare crash when menu is hidden while browsing it
-  * End move/resize more cleanly when focus moves during a move/resize
-  * Don't focus new windows when browsing a menu or moving/resizing a window,
-    just flash the window instead, so that the menu/move/resize doesn't have to
-    cancel.

-    log in.
-  * The &lt;desktop&gt; section from the configuration file is only used for

-    the server can still lock up though, it is not recommended to do this!
-  * Better handling of window types such as docks, utility windows, tool bar
-    windows. Clicking to focus these windows is done more intelligently.  Dock
-    windows no longer get focus when you click them, so that you don't have

-    from other apps like pagers
-  * Take advantage of ksmserver (KDE Session Manager) features
-  * KDE/Openbox and GNOME/Openbox options for display manager GDM/KDM. Use
-    openbox-gnome-session and openbox-kde-session to run a GNOME or KDE
-    session with Openbox as the window manager.
-  * Titlebar buttons autohide when hiding won't move other buttons (removed
-    the hideDisabled option from config file)
-  * Support user time window hint, which is good for laptops power usage
-  * When legacy windows raise themselves, interpreate as wanting to be
-    activated. Makes Firefox more pleasant.
-  * Don't show handles on windows that cant resize for more extreme visual
-    minimalism
-  * Let you move maximized windows between Xinerama monitors
-  * Improve application awareness of focus, e.g. Kopete and Firefox, so they

-    application is focused
-  * Improvements in the distributed themes
-  * Add new Clearlooks and Clearlooks-Olive themes by John McKnight
-  * Fonts are no longer loaded from theme. They are loaded from the rc.xml
-    config file. Font shadow settings are still loaded from the theme though.

-    (button masks) will be centered
-  * Default titlebar button icons (as xbms) installed to /usr/share/doc/openbox
-  * New mouse binding contexts Left, Right, TLCorner, TRCorner and Top. These
-    need bindings in config file to be useful. Also new context Bottom which
-    is synonym for Handle.
-  * W is no longer hard coded to Mod4. It is now a shortcut for Super, which

-3.3.1:
-  * Fix panels getting a border with keepBorder turned on.
-  * Fix a crash in mirrorhorizontal when drawing a surface with width 1.
-
-3.3:
-  * Add a showDelay option for the dock.
-  * Fixed onscreen-keeping code which broke a bit in -rc2.
-  * Fix incorrect handling of window properties on 64 bit arches.
-  * Fix pixelsize being the same as size for pango, now it is correct.
-  * Fix drawing of icons taller than wide, eg gimp.
-  * Add a 'mirrorhorizontal' gradient, like horizontal but mirrored in the
-    center and 'splitvertical' which is like vertical but nonlinear in a fancy
-    way.
-  * Translations for de, hr and zh_TW added.
-  * Add initial per-app settings support.
-  * Fix some outstanding issues with 64-bit support.
-  * Add an optional delay for displaying submenus so you can move the mouse
-    over some entries without flashing each submenu.
-  * Plug some minor memleaks and fix minor bugs.
-  * Changed algorithm for downscaling window icons.
-  * New themes!
-  * Disable support for libstartup-notification by default, it doesn't seem
-    to work well.
-  * Allow disabling of duplicate window numbering by option titleNumber in
-    theme section.
-  * Add moverelative and resizerelative actions.
-  * Option middle for menus that make submenus be centered instead of aligned
-    by the top edge to the parent entry.
-  * Fix transient (ie dialog) windows being placed offscreen if the parent
-    is close to the edge of the screen.
-
-3.3-rc2:
-  * Fixed some typos and errors in rc.xsd
-  * Add the noStrut option to the dock (to allow maximizing windows over it),
-    useful when it is not in the above layer.
-  * Fix transparent terminals not updating when using ToggleDecor.
-  * Yet more poking at the onscreen-keeping code, should now do the right
-    thing always.
-  * Add an option to hide disabled buttons instead of showing them as disabled.
-  * Hopefully fixed all the remaining pango issues. The new 1.10 release also
-    fixes shadows again.
-  * I think the lib linking in Makefile.am is right now, please tell me if it
-    isn't.
-  * Added a finnish translation and some minor updates to others.
-  * Fixed configure.ac so --enable-pango doesn't disable pango support or the
-    other way around, make enabled be default to get some extra testing.
-
-3.3-rc1:
-  * Poked around a bit in the code that keeps windows onscreen, if you
-    are using xinerama, please let me know if things are better/worse/same.
-  * Add support for pango, disabled by default due to a bug in pango 1.8 that
-    breaks shadows, it works fine with 1.6.x though. Poke the pango developers
-    here http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169622 if you want this
-    to be fixed.
-  * Made edge resist and Send/MoveToEdge not hit windows at layers below
-    the current one, add option to disable this behaviour.
-  * Fixed directional focus not getting trapped in omnipresent windows
-  * Fixed focus actions when bound to the mouse, normal focus cycle is always
-    linear and directional focus is totally disabled, it makes no sense
-    anyway, just move the mouse.
-  * Added an option for the raise/lower/raiselower/unshaderaise/shadelower
-    options called group that lets you bind stuff to raise/lower the whole
-    window group. <action name="raise"><group>yes</group></action>
-  * Add various new actions. I haven't updated the web docs yet, but I think
-    I managed to get all of them listed in rc.xsd.
-  * Bugs 1783, 1812, 1863, 1905, 2005, 1957 fixed.
-  * Some translations added. (ca, no, pl, ru, fr)
-
-3.2:
-  * Added spanish and swedish translations
-  * Changed "Unnamed Desktop" to "Desktop n" where n is the actual
-    number of the desktop
-  * Hopefully no more of the hanging X totally bug
-  * the fullscreen property now overrides aspect hints, all programs i've
-    tried that use it (mplayer and tvtime) handle the aspect internally
-    anyway, this just makes sure you have black borders all the way to the
-    edge. If this breaks anything for you, let me know.
-  * Added M as an alias for Mod3 in the same manner that W is an alias for Mod4
-  * Added probably too many options and actions
-    * ToggleDockAutohide to toggle the autohide option at runtime,
-      doesn't save it to the config
-    * keepBorder option to set if you want the 1-pixel border when you
-      toggleDecorations
-    * added popupShow and popupPosition to control where and when the
-      move/resize-popup is shown, these go in the resize section of the config
-      popupPosition can be Top or Center, popupShow can be Always, Never or
-      Nonpixel (this is the default).
-    * Added the xorStyle option to change the behaviour of menus along the bottom
-      edge, note that the default is true
-    * warpPointer option in the menu section to control if the mouse cursor is
-      to be warped by openbox when the menu moves to keep on screen to keep the
-      cursor in the same place relative to the menu. (I think i got that right)
-    * Added back the focusLast option (this controls what happens when you
-      change desktops and have followMouse on)
-    * Added an option to set which desktop to start on when you start openbox,
-      firstdesk, for example you might like to set it to 5 if you have a 3x3
-      grid to start in the middle.
-  * I think that was everything, have fun

-		       Version 2, June 1991
-
- Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-			    Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-    parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Program.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Program or works based on it.
-
-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-Foundation.
-
-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-			    NO WARRANTY
-
-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
-    (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-    GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
-when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
-  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
-Public License instead of this License.

-Beware the Client.transient_for. It can be set to a !NULL value of TRAN_GROUP,
-which is not a valid pointer. You must ALWAYS check for TRAN_GROUP before
-following transient_for. However if it is transient for the group, this
-excludes other windows whom are transient for the group, and windows which
-are children of the window (infinite loops would result)!
-
-When using coordinates/sizes of windows, make sure you use the right area. The
-Client.area rect is the reference point and size of the *CLIENT* window. This
-value is not what you see in any shape or form, and gravity is applied to it to
-translate it into what you see. The Client.frame.area is the actual position
-and size of the entire frame. This is usually the value you want to use, unless
-you are in client.c (probably) and adjusting/using the position or size from
-the client's perspective.
-
-Indentation
------------
-For openbox, we aim to have consistent coding style. Some, but surely
-not all, guidelines:
- * use 4 space indents
- * tabs should not appear in source files
- * closing braces always go on a new line
- * for functions, the opening brace goes on a new line
-     void foo()
-     {
-         hi;
-     }
- * for control blocks, the opening brace goes on the same line as the
-   condition, unless the condition spans more than one line. then the brace
-   goes on a new line.
-     if (one line) {
-         hi;
-     }
-     if (first line &&
-         second line)
-     {
-         hi;
-     }
- * always use braces around conditional blocks that consist of more than one
-   line, even if they contain a single statement
-     if (check) {
-         /* Check was true. */
-         yay = true(ok,
-                    thanks);
-     }
- * don't need to use braces for conditional blocks that use only a single
-   line, including comments.
-     if (check)
-         all_on_one_line_so_no_braces_needed();
- * when in doubt look at the rest of the source
- * vim users can use "set expandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4
-   softtabstop=4" for some of this

--X Cursor library/headers (devel package)
--Startup Notification library/headers 0.8+ (devel package)
-
-We recommend the latest versions of all these packages.
-
-*) for versions below 0.18.1 cvs is needed, above that, see autopoint --version
-
-Do the following to build and install Openbox in git:
-
-% ./bootstrap
-% ./configure
-% make
-su to root and
-% make install
-or
-% sudo make install
-
-Don't try running it from the openbox/ directory without installing, it won't
-work. It needs to be installed before it is run.
-
-The following commands will be available: openbox-session,
-  openbox-gnome-session, openbox-kde-session, and openbox.
-
-See the man pages for details about them.  If you want to run Openbox on its
-  own, you probably want to run "openbox-session".

-.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
-.PP 
-Openbox is minimalistic, highly configurable, next generation window 
-manager with extensive standards support. 
-.PP 
-You can start Openbox in three ways: 
-.PP 
-If you run a display manager such as GDM, you will find 3 entries 
-in the login session type menu for Openbox: 
-\fBGNOME/Openbox\fR, \fBKDE/Openbox\fR       and \fBOpenbox\fR. If you want to use Openbox 
-within GNOME or KDE, you can choose the appropriate entry, and it will 
-launch GNOME or KDE with Openbox as the window manager. 
-.PP 
-The third option at log in, which is \fBOpenbox\fR       without a session manager, uses the \fBopenbox-session\fR       command to start Openbox. On log in, \fBopenbox\fR will 
-run the ~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh script if it exists, and will run 
-the system-wide script @configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh otherwise. You 
-may place anything you want to run automatically in those files, for 
-example: 
- 
-.PP 
-.RS 
-.PP 
-.nf 
-xsetroot \-solid grey & 
-gnome-settings-daemon & 
-.fi 
-.RE 
-.PP 
-Make sure that each line is followed by a "&" or else the script will 
-stop there and further commands will not be executed. You can use the 
-@configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh file as an example for creating your 
-own. 
-.PP 
-The default @configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh runs a number of things 
-with Openbox. 
-.PP 
-Lastly, if you use \fBstartx\fR to launch your X 
-session, you can set up a ~/.xinitrc file to run 
-\fBopenbox-session\fR and follow the same directions as 
-above regarding the autostart.sh file. 
-.PP 
-You can use the \fBobconf\fR tool to configure Openbox 
-easily with a graphical interface, however more in-depth configuration 
-is possible by editing the configuration files by hand. 
-.PP 
-The default configuration and menu files are installed in 
-@configdir@/openbox/, and the user configuration is placed in 
-~/.config/openbox/. You can copy the default configuration and menus 
-to ~/.config/openbox and edit it to your liking. 
-.SH "OPTIONS" 
-.PP 
-These are the possible options that \fBopenbox\fR accepts: 
-.IP "\fB\-\-help\fP" 10 
-Show a summary of the command line options available 
-and exit. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-version\fP" 10 
-Show the version of the program and exit. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-replace\fP" 10 
-Replace the currently running window manager. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-config-file FILE\fP" 10 
-Specify the path to the config file to use. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-reconfigure\fP" 10 
-If Openbox is already running on the display, tell it to 
-reload its configuration. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-restart\fP" 10 
-If Openbox is already running on the display, tell it to 
-restart. This is useful if you have upgraded Openbox and don't 
-want to restart X. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-exit\fP" 10 
-Exit Openbox. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-sm-disable\fP" 10 
-Do not connect to the session manager. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-sync\fP" 10 
-Run in synchronous mode (for debugging). 
-.IP "\fB\-\-startup CMD\fP" 10 
-Run CMD after starting. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-debug\fP" 10 
-Display debugging output. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-debug-focus\fP" 10 
-Display debugging output for focus handling. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-debug-session\fP" 10 
-Display debugging output for session management. 
-.IP "\fB\-\-debug-xinerama\fP" 10 
-Split the display into two fake xinerama regions, if 
-xinerama is not already enabled. This is for debugging 
-xinerama support. 
-.SH "SEE ALSO" 
-.PP 
-obconf (1), openbox-session(1), openbox-gnome-session(1), 
-openbox-kde-session(1).
